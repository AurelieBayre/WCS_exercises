# Rules:

* don't select with the ID attribute ( #item1) . Always use class (.myclass) and elements ( h1 ). Why? because it will help make your design reproductible. Seperate as much as you can the content from the look.
* the reward box is almost opaque but not totally. It has rounded corners.
* the number (1000) must be orange
* the reward text should appear on 2 ligns
* there's an overall opaque filter on the picture

* Make a hover effect: 
  * when the mouse hovers on the picture: the name will move to the bottom of the picture and the name font size will diminish
  * the reward box will disappear
  * the semi opaque filter on the whole image will disappear
